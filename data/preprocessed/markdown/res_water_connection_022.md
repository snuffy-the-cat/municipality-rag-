# Water Service Connection Applications

## Procedure Overview

As a municipal employee, you will be responsible for processing water service connection applications on a weekly basis. This involves reviewing and approving applications, conducting site visits (if necessary), and ensuring compliance with city regulations.

### Step 1: Review Application

When an application is received, review it thoroughly to ensure all required information is provided:

*   Verify the applicant's identity and property ownership
*   Check for any outstanding fees or issues with the account
*   Ensure all necessary permits are attached

Use UtilityConnect to track the status of applications and communicate with applicants.

### Step 2: Conduct Site Visit (if necessary)

If a site visit is required, schedule it with the applicant. During the visit:

*   Inspect the property's water meter and connection
*   Verify the meter is properly installed and functioning correctly
*   Check for any signs of tampering or leaks

Document all findings in UtilityConnect.

### Step 3: Approve Application

Once the application is complete and any site visits have been conducted, approve the application:

*   Review the application one last time to ensure accuracy
*   Verify that all necessary permits are attached
*   Use UtilityConnect to notify the applicant of approval or denial
