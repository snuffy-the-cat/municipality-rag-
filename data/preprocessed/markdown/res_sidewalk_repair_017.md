# Sidewalk Repair Requests

## Overview
As a municipal employee, you will be responsible for handling sidewalk repair requests from residents. This process involves receiving and investigating complaints, assigning work orders, and coordinating with public works staff to complete repairs.

## Procedures

1. **Receiving Complaints**
When a resident submits a complaint about a damaged sidewalk, it will be assigned to your queue via our work order system.
2. **Investigation**
Review the complaint details and assess the damage. If necessary, contact the resident to gather additional information or schedule an inspection.
3. **Work Order Creation**
Create a new work order in our system with the following information:
	* Description of the damaged sidewalk
	* Location (address or nearest intersection)
	* Estimated repair cost
4. **Assignment and Coordination**
Assign the work order to a public works crew, taking into account their workload and schedule. Coordinate with James Martinez (Code Enforcement Officer) for assistance if needed.
5. **Repair Completion**
Verify that the repairs have been completed to our satisfaction. Close out the work order in our system.
