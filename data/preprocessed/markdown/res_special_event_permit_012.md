# Special Event Permits

## Procedures

When processing special event permits, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Application Review**: Upon receiving an application for a special event permit, review it to ensure all required information is provided.
	* Verify that the applicant has completed and submitted the Special Event Permit Application Form (SEPA-01) in full.
	* Check if the application includes the necessary supporting documents, such as proof of liability insurance and a detailed event layout.
2. **Permit Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the permit application to ensure compliance with municipal regulations.
	* Consult relevant sections of the Municipal Code (Chapter 12: Events) to ensure that all requirements are met.
	* Verify that the applicant has obtained any necessary permits or licenses from other departments, such as the Fire Department or Police Department.
3. **Permit Approval/Denial**: After reviewing the application and supporting documents, make a decision on whether to approve or deny the permit.
	* If approved, issue the special event permit with any conditions or requirements clearly stated.
	* If denied, provide written reasons for denial and inform the applicant of their appeal rights.
