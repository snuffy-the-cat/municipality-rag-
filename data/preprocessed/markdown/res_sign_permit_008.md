# Overview
As a municipal employee, I review sign permit applications to ensure compliance with the Municipal Sign Code (MSC) and zoning regulations. My primary goal is to provide timely and accurate reviews that support the planning and development of our community.

## Procedure

### 1. Receive and Review Application
I receive sign permit applications via PermitTrack, a web-based permitting system. I review each application for completeness, ensuring all required documents are attached, including:
	* Signed and notarized affidavit (Form S-001)
	* Plot plan or site survey
	* Zoning verification letter from the Planning Department

### 2. Verify Compliance with MSC and Zoning Regulations
I verify that the proposed sign complies with the MSC and zoning regulations, specifically:
	* Sign size and placement requirements (MSC Section 5.1-5.3)
	* Distance requirements from property lines and adjacent signs (ZC Section 10.1)

### 3. Issue Permit or Request Additional Information
If the application is complete and compliant with MSC and zoning regulations, I issue a sign permit. If additional information is required, I request it via PermitTrack or phone (555-1234).

## Key Contacts

* Sarah Chen, Zoning Manager (sarah.chen@northtown.gov, 555-1111)
