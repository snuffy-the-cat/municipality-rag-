# Overview
As a municipal employee, it's essential to register dogs with the proper licenses. This process is crucial for public safety and animal welfare.

# Procedure

## Step 1: Verify Dog Ownership
Confirm that the dog is owned by a New Haven resident by checking their identification and verifying their address. Use Form NH-001 (Dog License Registration) to document this information.

## Step 2: Determine License Fees
Determine the license fee based on the dog's breed, age, and vaccination status. Refer to Chapter 6 of the New Haven Municipal Code for specific fees and regulations.

## Step 3: Issue License and Tag
Issue a dog license and attach the corresponding tag to the dog's collar. Make sure to record the license number in our database (if available) or on Form NH-001.
