# Certificate of Occupancy Issuance

## Overview
As a municipal employee, I am responsible for issuing Certificates of Occupancy (CO) to building owners. This involves reviewing permit applications, conducting inspections, and verifying that buildings meet local codes and regulations.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Review Permit Application
Review the permit application submitted by the building owner to ensure it includes all required information and documentation. Use PermitTrack to track the status of the permit.

```markdown
* Check if all necessary permits have been obtained (e.g., building, electrical, plumbing)
* Verify that the permit has not expired or been revoked
### Step 2: Conduct Inspection
Schedule an inspection with the building owner using PermitTrack. Ensure that all required inspections are completed before issuing a CO.

```markdown
* Perform a visual inspection of the property to ensure compliance with local codes and regulations (e.g., building, electrical, plumbing)
* Check if any issues were found during previous inspections or permit applications
```

### Step 3: Issue Certificate of Occupancy
Once all requirements have been met, issue a CO to the building owner. Ensure that the CO includes all necessary information, such as the property address, permit numbers, and expiration date.

```markdown
* Verify that all permit requirements have been met (e.g., payment of fees, completion of inspections)
* Review the CO for accuracy before issuing it to the building owner
```
