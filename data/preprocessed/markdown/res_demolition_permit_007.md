# Demolition Permit Processing

## Procedures

1. **Initial Review**: Upon receipt of a demolition permit application, review it for completeness and ensure all required documents are attached. This includes:
	* Completed demolition permit application form (DPA-001)
	* Site plan with location marked
	* Proof of property ownership or authorization to demolish
	* Compliance with the City's Zoning Ordinance and Building Code

2. **Contact Property Owner**: Reach out to the property owner via phone (555-1234) or email (john.doe@urbancity.gov) to confirm demolition plans and provide any additional information required for permit processing.

3. **PermitTrack Update**: Log all application details into PermitTrack, including:
	* Application date
	* Property address
	* Type of demolition (partial or full)

4. **Zoning Review**: Forward the application to Sarah Chen (Zoning Manager) via email (sarah.chen@urbancity.gov) for zoning review and approval.

5. **Building Inspection**: Schedule a building inspection with the Building Inspector's office to confirm that all safety measures are in place before demolition begins.

6. **Permit Issuance**: Once all requirements have been met, issue the demolition permit via PermitTrack.

## Handoff Notes

As I'm leaving my position as Demolition Permit Processor, I'd like to remind my colleague that it's essential to keep up-to-date with changes in zoning regulations and building codes. Please review the City's website (urbancity.gov) regularly for updates and consult with Sarah Chen if you have any questions.

Some common mistakes to watch out for include:
* Incomplete applications
* Failure to provide required documentation
* Misinterpretation of zoning regulations

If you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to reach out to me via email (jane.doe@urbancity.gov) or phone (555-1234). I'll do my best to assist you.
