# Tree Removal Permits

## Overview

As a municipal employee in the Code Enforcement department, I am responsible for reviewing and issuing tree removal permits. This process involves ensuring that property owners comply with local regulations and ordinances related to tree preservation.

## Procedures

### Step 1: Receive Permit Application

* Review incoming permit applications from property owners or contractors
* Verify that all required information is provided on the application form (Tree Removal Permit Form - SPR-TRP-001)
* Ensure that the property owner has submitted a completed tree inventory form (Tree Inventory Form - SPR-TIF-002)

### Step 2: Determine Permit Eligibility

* Check if the property is located in a designated Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) as per Section 12.4 of the Springville Municipal Code
* Verify that the proposed tree removal meets local regulations and ordinances, including those related to environmental impact and public safety

### Step 3: Review Permit Application

* Evaluate the permit application for completeness and accuracy
* Check if all necessary documentation has been provided, such as:
	+ Property owner's identification (driver's license or passport)
	+ Proof of property ownership (deed or title)
	+ Tree removal plan with specific details on which trees will be removed and why

### Step 4: Issue Permit

* If the application is complete and meets all requirements, issue a permit with a unique permit number
* Provide the permit to the applicant via email or in-person delivery (per local policy)
