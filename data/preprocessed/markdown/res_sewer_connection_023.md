## Responsibilities

As a municipal employee handling Sewer Connection Applications, my primary responsibility is to ensure that all incoming applications are processed efficiently and in accordance with the Municipal Code (Chapter 12, Article 3). This includes reviewing applications for completeness, verifying property ownership, and scheduling inspections as necessary.

## Procedures

### Step 1: Receive Application
When an application is received, I verify that it contains all required information, including a completed Sewer Connection Application Form (SCAF-01) and a copy of the property deed. If any information is missing, I contact the applicant to request additional documentation.

### Step 2: Review Application
I review the application to ensure compliance with Municipal Code requirements. This includes verifying that the property is located within the municipal sewer system boundaries and that all necessary permits have been obtained.

### Step 3: Schedule Inspection (if required)
If an inspection is necessary, I schedule it through UtilityConnect and notify the applicant of the scheduled date and time.

## Forms and Templates

* Sewer Connection Application Form (SCAF-01) - available on the Utilities Department website
* Property Deed Verification Form (PDEV-02) - available on the Assessor's Office website

## Handoff Notes

As I depart, I want to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. Please note the following:

* There are currently 5 pending applications that require review and processing.
* The most recent inspection was scheduled for February 15th and was conducted by Lisa Nguyen.
