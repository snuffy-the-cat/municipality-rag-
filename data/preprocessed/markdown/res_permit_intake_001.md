# Permit Application Intake Procedure

## Purpose
The purpose of this procedure is to guide the intake process for permit applications, ensuring that all required information and supporting documents are collected before routing the application to permit review.

## Procedures

1. **Initial Review**
Upon receipt of a new permit application, I conduct an initial review to ensure completeness and accuracy.
	* Verify that all required forms (e.g., Building Permit Application Form, Zoning Permit Application Form) have been submitted.
	* Check for any missing or incomplete information.
2. **Contact Applicant**
If the application is incomplete or requires additional information, I contact the applicant via phone (555-1234 ext. 222) or email (john.doe@oakdale.gov).
	* Explain the required documentation and provide clear instructions on how to complete it.
3. **Payment Verification**
Prior to routing the application to permit review, I verify payment of all applicable fees using PermitTrack.
	* Follow up with fee processing if any discrepancies arise.
4. **Routing Complete Applications**
Once the application is complete and payment is verified, I route it to permit review via res_building_permit_002.
	* Ensure that all necessary documentation and supporting materials are attached.

## Handoff Notes

As I depart this role, I want to ensure a smooth transition for my colleagues. Please note the following:

* Regularly check PermitTrack for new applications and follow up with applicants as needed.
* Be sure to verify payment of fees before routing applications to permit review.
