# Fire Safety Inspection Scheduling

## Overview
As a municipal employee responsible for fire safety inspection scheduling, your primary goal is to ensure that all commercial businesses in the city comply with fire safety codes and regulations. This responsibility requires daily attention to schedule inspections, follow up on incomplete applications, and communicate with business owners.

## Procedures

```

### Step 4: Conduct Inspections
