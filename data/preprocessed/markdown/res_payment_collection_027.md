# Payment Collection and Receipt

## Overview
As a municipal employee responsible for payment collection and receipt, your primary goal is to ensure timely and accurate processing of payments from residents and businesses. This includes handling cash, checks, credit card transactions, and online payments.

## Procedures

### Daily Collections

1. Arrive at the Municipal Center by 8:30 AM to begin daily collections.
2. Check the previous day's collections using the FinanceHub system to identify any missing or late payments.
3. Review the payment log for any errors or discrepancies.
4. Verify that all payments are properly recorded and reconciled with the accounting department (see res_accounting_reconciliation_028).

### Handling Payments

1. When a resident or business pays by cash, check, or credit card:
	* Record the transaction in the FinanceHub system using the correct payment type code (PMT-CASH, PMT-CHECK, etc.).
	* Verify that all necessary information is collected, including name, address, and account number.
2. When a resident or business pays online:
	* Review the online payment confirmation to ensure accuracy.
	* Record the transaction in the FinanceHub system using the correct payment type code (PMT-ONLINE).

### Reconciliation

1. Daily: Reconcile all payments with the accounting department via the res_accounting_reconciliation_028 process.
2. Weekly: Review and verify that all payments are accurately recorded and reconciled.
