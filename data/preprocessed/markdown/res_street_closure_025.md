# Street Closure Permits

## Overview

As a Public Works staff member responsible for Street Closure Permits, I have managed the process of issuing permits for street closures related to utility services. This document outlines my knowledge and responsibilities.

## Procedures

### Requesting Information

* When receiving a request from a resident or business owner for a street closure permit:
	+ Contact Robert Chen (Utilities Manager) via phone (555-1234 ext 2) or email ([robert.chen@cityofsanfrancisco.gov](mailto:robert.chen@cityofsanfrancisco.gov)) to confirm the request and gather information about the proposed closure.
* Utilize UtilityConnect system to track permit requests, status updates, and related documents.

### Permit Application Process

1. **Initial Review**
	+ Verify that all required documentation is submitted (e.g., event application form 101-ABC).
	+ Ensure compliance with City Ordinance 14.12.05: Street Closures.
2. **Notify Utilities Manager**
	+ Inform Robert Chen of the permit request, including relevant details and supporting documents.
3. **Coordinate with Other Departments**
	+ Reach out to relevant departments (e.g., Police Department, Parking Enforcement) for any necessary approvals or notifications.
4. **Issue Permit**
	+ Once all requirements are met, issue a street closure permit (Form 102-DEF).
	+ Provide the permit details and conditions of approval to the applicant.

### Common Mistakes

* Failing to confirm requests with Robert Chen before proceeding.
* Inadequate documentation or failure to follow City Ordinance guidelines.
* Not coordinating with other relevant departments, leading to delays or complications.

## Handoff Notes

As I transition out of this role, I want to ensure a smooth handover. Please note the following:

* Review the UtilityConnect system for outstanding permit requests and update the status accordingly.
* Reach out to Robert Chen to confirm any pending requests or issues.
* Familiarize yourself with City Ordinance 14.12.05: Street Closures, and review permit application form 101-ABC.
* Be prepared to address any questions or concerns from residents, business owners, or other stakeholders.

## Tips for Success

* Regularly review the UtilityConnect system to stay on top of requests and deadlines.
* Establish open communication channels with Robert Chen and other relevant departments.
* Stay informed about City Ordinance updates and changes to procedures.
