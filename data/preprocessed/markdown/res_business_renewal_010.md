# Business License Renewal - Handoff Notes

**Introduction**
---------------

Welcome to your new role in the Licensing department. As part of our handoff process, we will cover the essential procedures for handling business license renewals.

### Overview of Business License Renewal Process

Business licenses need to be renewed annually by March 31st. The renewal process involves ensuring that all businesses within the municipality have an active initial license before proceeding with renewals. We use the BusinessHub system to manage and track licenses, permits, and fees.

**Step-by-Step Procedure**

### Step 1: Verify Active Initial License

Before processing a business license renewal, we must verify if the business has an active initial license. This is crucial as per the Municipal Code (Section 12.5).

*   Check the BusinessHub system for any discrepancies or inactive licenses.
*   Contact the business owner via phone at (555) 123-4567 or email [john.smith@municipality.gov](mailto:john.smith@municipality.gov) to confirm their license status.

### Step 2: Review Renewal Application

Once we have confirmed that the business has an active initial license, we review the renewal application for completeness and accuracy. This includes:

*   Checking if all required documents are attached.
*   Ensuring that all fees are paid in full (renewal fee is $100, plus a 5% late penalty if payment is made after March 31st).

### Step 3: Process Renewal

After verifying the application and ensuring all fees have been paid:

*   Update the BusinessHub system with the renewed license details.
*   Send an email confirmation to the business owner at [jane.doe@municipality.gov](mailto:jane.doe@municipality.gov) to inform them that their renewal has been processed.

### Step 4: Follow-up

*   Schedule a follow-up review of all renewals within two weeks of processing.
*   Check for any discrepancies or issues that may have arisen during the renewal process.
