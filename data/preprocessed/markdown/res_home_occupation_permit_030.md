# Overview
Home Occupation Permits are issued to residents who wish to operate a business from their home. This permit ensures that the business does not impact neighboring properties or violate zoning regulations.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Application Review
I review each application for completeness, ensuring all required documents and fees are submitted. I also verify that the business complies with local zoning ordinances (Section 14-20 of the Municipal Code).

* Document Checklist:
	+ Completed Home Occupation Permit Application Form (HOPA-001)
	+ Proof of Business Liability Insurance
	+ Floor Plan of the Property

### Step 2: Site Inspection and Verification
I conduct a site inspection to ensure that the business operation complies with local regulations. I verify that all necessary equipment and infrastructure are in place, and that noise levels do not exceed permitted limits (Section 14-25).

* Contact Information:
	+ Maria Rodriguez (Business Licensing Manager), ext. 555-1234, maria.rodriguez@municipality.gov

### Step 3: Permit Issuance
Once the application is complete and site inspection is satisfactory, I issue the Home Occupation Permit. The permit holder must renew their permit annually.
