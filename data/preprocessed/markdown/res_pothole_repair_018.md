# Pothole Repair Requests

## Responsibilities

* Respond to pothole repair requests from residents and businesses via phone, email, or in-person.
* Conduct site visits to assess the severity of potholes and determine the necessary repairs.
* Coordinate with Public Works staff to schedule repairs and provide updates to requesters.

## Procedures

1. Receive and log pothole repair requests using the [Public Works Work Order Form (PW-001)](https://www.municipality.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PW-001.pdf).
2. Review the location of each pothole on a map to determine priority and assign a work order number.
3. Contact James Martinez, Code Enforcement Officer, to report high-priority requests and obtain assistance with complex cases (phone: 555-1234, email: james.martinez@municipality.gov).
4. Coordinate with Public Works staff to schedule repairs and provide updates to requesters.

## Handoff Notes

As I hand off this responsibility to you, please make sure to:

* Familiarize yourself with the City's road repair policies and procedures (Chapter 12 of the Municipal Code).
* Review the list of active work orders and prioritize requests based on severity and location.
* Communicate regularly with James Martinez and Public Works staff to ensure smooth coordination.

## Common Issues

* Be aware that some residents may not report potholes until they become hazardous, so it's essential to respond promptly and provide updates on repair schedules.
* If a resident reports multiple potholes in the same area, prioritize repairs based on severity and location to minimize disruptions.

## Example Scenario

A resident emails us about a large pothole on Main Street that is causing damage to their vehicle. You receive the email and log it as PW-001-2023-01. After reviewing the map, you determine that this pothole requires immediate attention due to its size and location. You contact James Martinez to report the high-priority request and obtain assistance with coordinating repairs.

## Tips

* Make sure to respond promptly to all requests, even if they are not urgent.
* Keep accurate records of each work order, including photos of the potholes before and after repair.
* Communicate regularly with residents and businesses to provide updates on repair schedules and outcomes.
