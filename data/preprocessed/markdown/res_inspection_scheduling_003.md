# Building Inspection Scheduling

## Overview
As a municipal employee responsible for building inspection scheduling, your primary goal is to ensure timely inspections of buildings within our jurisdiction. This responsibility falls under the category of Permits & Licensing, with a high priority due to its impact on public safety.

## Procedures

### 1. Review and Assign Inspections

* Daily, review permit applications in PermitTrack for scheduled inspections.
* Identify missing information or required documentation from applicants.
* Contact applicants via phone (555-1234) or email ([sarah.chen@municipality.gov](mailto:sarah.chen@municipality.gov)) to request necessary details.

### 2. Coordinate Inspection Schedules

* Schedule inspections with licensed inspectors and building owners using PermitTrack's calendar feature.
* Ensure compliance with local building codes (e.g., [Municipal Code Section 7.1](https://www.municipality.gov/code-of-ordinances)).
* Document inspection schedules, including dates, times, and assigned inspectors.

### 3. Notify Building Owners and Inspectors

* Send notification letters or emails to building owners and inspectors at least two days prior to scheduled inspections.
* Include details on the purpose of the inspection, required documents, and any specific instructions.

## Handoff Notes
As I depart, please note that my successor will need to:

* Familiarize themselves with PermitTrack's calendar feature for scheduling inspections.
* Develop a rapport with licensed inspectors and building owners to ensure smooth coordination of inspections.
* Regularly review permit applications in PermitTrack for missing information or required documentation.

**Tips and Common Mistakes**

* Ensure all inspection schedules are updated in PermitTrack to avoid conflicts or missed appointments.
* Communicate clearly with building owners and inspectors to avoid misunderstandings about inspection requirements.
* Double-check local building codes to ensure compliance during inspections.
