# Daily Accounting Reconciliation

Reconcile daily financial transactions, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Review Daily Transactions
Login to FinanceHub using your municipal credentials. Verify all incoming payments, fees, and other transactions from the previous day.

### Step 2: Reconcile with Bank Statements
Obtain the daily bank statement for New Haven's checking account (account #NH-1234). Compare the statement with the transactions recorded in FinanceHub. Identify any discrepancies or errors.

### Step 3: Update Financial Records
If no discrepancies are found, proceed to update the financial records in FinanceHub. Record all payments and fees received, as well as any transfers or adjustments made during the day.
