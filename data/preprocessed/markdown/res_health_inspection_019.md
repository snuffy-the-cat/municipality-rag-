2. **Conducting the Inspection**
	* Arrive at the scheduled time, dressed in uniform and equipped with necessary equipment.
	* Introduce yourself to the facility owner or manager and explain the purpose of the inspection.
	* Conduct a thorough walk-through of the facility, observing:
		+ Food handling and preparation practices
		+ Cleaning and sanitizing procedures
		+ Storage and disposal practices
		+ Equipment maintenance and calibration
3. **Reporting Findings**
	* Complete the Food Service Establishment Inspection Report (Form FS-001) with detailed findings.
	* Document any non-compliance issues, including:
		+ Observed hazards or deficiencies
		+ Corrective actions taken during the inspection
4. **Follow-up and Follow-through**
	* Schedule a follow-up inspection to verify corrective actions have been implemented.
	* Maintain accurate records of all inspections, including:
		+ Inspection reports
		+ Correspondence with facility owners or managers
5. **Collaboration with Other Departments**
